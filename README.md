# 6.01-Final-Project

A robot waiter that can fetch your order of drinks. 

## Features
**Gesture sensing:** The robot uses Bayesian probabilistic models to analyze thermal camera imaging data and determine the number of fingers raised. 

**Driving:** The robot then uses an internal state machine combined with linear-time-invariant models to complete autonomous wall-following driving to fetch your order.
